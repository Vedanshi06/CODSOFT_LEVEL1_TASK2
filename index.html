        <p>Good day, I was born in Chandigarh in a Defence family. I went to different schools Air force school, KVS, Sophia High School, DAV public School. I completed my education from a nearby school i.e Aakash international school after that I admitted into Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University to pursue B. TECH IIOT. 
            Being in a Defence Family I adapt to new places, new schools, and new peers. 
            I'm highly motivated and ambitious individual. I have a strong understanding of skills/programs and am always looking to learn more. I am a quick learner and am able to adapt to new environment and situations easily, also a good communicator and am able to effectively convey my ideas and thoughts. 
            I love Dancing and singing. I usually spend my leisure time reading books or playing badminton. I like reading suspense, horror and thriller novels. I also like travelling to new cities and places around the world. Also a Nature lover.
            </p>
